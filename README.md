# BaseDAO

***Collectively building the future ecosystem on Aptos***

BaseDAO simplifies the creation and management of Decentralized Autonomous Organisations (DAOs) on the Aptos blockchain. 

With just one click, anyone can establish a DAO for their community, choosing a governance model that aligns closest with their group’s unique needs and preferences. 

As the New York Times describes, "a DAO (pronounced dow) is a relatively new kind of organisational structure, built with blockchain technology, that is often described as a sort of crypto co-op.”  

While DAOs originated within the crypto and blockchain space, their applications extend to a variety of real-world domains, such as life sciences with LabDAO and humanitarian projects through Impact DAOs. 

As technology and the world evolves, DAOs have become an essential tool for decentralised governance that can support a wide range of purposes — from investment groups to project collaborations, and even initiatives aimed at global change.

## DAO Models for Different Community Needs

BaseDAO offers various governance models to suit different types of communities:

**Standard DAO**: This model supports collective decision-making, allowing members that hold the DAO’s governance tokens to participate in proposing, voting on, and executing ideas together.

**Guild DAO**: Designed for specialised and focused groups, the Guild DAO model incorporates a centralized leadership structure without the need for governance tokens, making it a good fit for small to medium communities.

**Hybrid DAO**: For communities that want a blend of democratic governance and role-based structures, the Hybrid DAO model offers flexibility with governance tokens and member roles together that influences a member’s vote and participation.

With BaseDAO, we want to abstract away the technical complexities, making it extremely easy for anyone to set up and manage a DAO, regardless of their technical expertise — so they can focus on what truly matters: building their community.

## Governance Process and Proposal Types

BaseDAO allows each DAO to tailor its governance mechanisms to fit its unique structure. 

A core element of this customization is Proposal Types, which control aspects such as the duration of a proposal, the required percentage of votes from the total governance token supply for execution, and the minimum amount needed to either vote or create a proposal of the given type.

Upon initialisation, each DAO is currently provided with a default Proposal Type. However, looking ahead, we plan to introduce two additional default Proposal Types to cater to various scenarios. 

For instance, DAOs could utilize quick proposals to gauge community sentiment on specific issues or longer proposals requiring a higher success threshold for serious topics that warrant extended discussion.

Proposal Types themselves can be added, modified, or removed through governance actions. In addition, in Guild DAOs and Hybrid DAOs, members holding leader roles (or those with a vote weight equal to or greater than the leader's minimum threshold) will be able to customise proposal types as well.

During a proposal's voting period (based on its corresponding proposal type), qualified users will be able to vote YAY, NAY, or PASS on the proposal. For Standard DAOs, qualified members would need to hold governance tokens equal to or above the min_amount_to_vote property in the Proposal Type. In contrast, for Guild DAOs, qualified members would required an assigned a role with a weightage equal to or above min_amount_to_vote. 

On the other hand, for Hybrid DAOs, user roles serve as a multiplier for their governance token balance. As such, even users without roles but holding sufficient governance tokens above the threshold would be able to vote. Essentially, these roles magnify or diminish users' voting weight on a customisable and flexible basis. 

Users will also be able to change their votes at any time before the proposal ends; their previous vote count will be removed, and a new vote count reflecting their current governance token balance or vote weight will be registered for the Standard DAO and Guild DAO respectively.

After a proposal's voting period ends, if it accumulates sufficient YAY votes to surpass the success threshold, any member can execute it. For example, suppose a Fungible Asset transfer proposal is executed successfully. In that case, it will trigger a transfer from the DAO module to the intended recipient with the specified amount in the proposal.

This execution mechanism applies to all proposal types except the standard proposal, which is intended for general discussions and polls rather than on-chain actions.

Through these flexible and customisable mechanisms, various groups and organisations will be able to utilise the DAO models on BaseDAO to suit their needs and purposes.

## Demo MVP

The BaseDAO demo is accessible at [https://aptosbasedao.com](https://aptosbasedao.com) on the Aptos Testnet. The demo showcases sample DAOs from the various DAO models.

**Features**:
- **Wallet Integration**: Users can connect their Aptos wallets to interact with the platform on the Aptos Testnet.

- **Sample DAOs**: Explore sample daos with detailed descriptions, images, and proposals

- **Faucet**: Users will be able to mint our governance tokens on the testnet to interact with our sample DAOS

- **Create Proposal**: Users are free to experiment and create proposals of their own on the Aptos Testnet

- **Vote for Proposal**: Users will be able to use governance tokens that they have minted to vote for proposals (Standard / Hybrid DAOs)

- **Real-Time Updates**: Successful votes will automatically update the proposal vote count

Our interactive demo provides a comprehensive preview of the BaseDAO platform. Users can explore sample DAOs with detailed descriptions, images, and proposals to get a feel for how the live site will operate.

We also prioritise the user journey in both funding and supporting campaigns, making the process straightforward and accessible. 

Once a vote is successfully made and the transaction is recorded on the blockchain, the proposal's progress updates automatically to reflect the new vote count.

The frontend demo for BaseDao is maintained in a separate repository to ensure that the Move contracts remain focused and well-organised.

## Tech Overview and Considerations

We follow the Aptos Object Model approach, storing Proposals on user accounts rather than on the DAO contract to decentralise data storage, enhance scalability, and optimise gas costs. 

The DAO contract maintains a ProposalRegistry struct that maps proposal IDs to their respective creators. Proposal IDs are unique and sequentially assigned, ensuring that no two proposals share the same ID, regardless of their creator.

As there is no factory pattern available on Aptos Move, compared to Solidity, where we can initialise a new module or smart contract from another, we adopt an unconventional approach to pre-generate DAO modules that can then be initialised.

A DAO module can only be initialised once, preventing any possible conflicts. To help with this approach, we have developed a [DAO generator Python script](https://github.com/0xblockbard/aptos-basedao-generator) that will be able to rapidly deploy any number of DAOs using an Aptos CLI subprocess. In the future, we plan to integrate this with a server so that a new DAO module can be generated on-demand when required instead.

## Dummy Data Script

We have also included a dummy data script to populate the BaseDAO Demo MVP with 9 sample DAOs. This helps to demonstrate our features and provides a realistic view of how DAOs appear and function on the site.

However, do take note that you will have to run the [BaseDAO generator script](https://github.com/0xblockbard/aptos-basedao-generator) to deploy some DAO modules first before running the dummy data script on the frontend.

In your localhost frontend, with your  you will need to run the Database seeder on the frontend to provide some initial DAO data values. 

```bash
# setup database migrations
php artisan migrate 
# setup sample seeded DAOs
php artisan db:seed 
```

## Future Plans

Looking ahead, here are some plans to expand the features and capabilities of BaseDAO in Phase 2.

### Planned Features:

- **Expand DAO Governance Models**: As more communities adopt decentralized governance, BaseDAO aims to expand its offering with additional governance models tailored for specific use cases. For example, a “Quadratic Voting DAO” could cater to communities interested in nuanced decision-making, while a “DAO-as-a-Service” model could support organizations needing turnkey solutions for various governance structures.

- **Launch DAO Toolkits for Community Management**: With a growing user base, we would also be able to develop and launch a suite of community management tools, including event scheduling, treasury management, and collaboration features. These toolkits will provide a comprehensive set of resources for communities to thrive and grow further.

- **Onboarding and Education Programs**: As DAOs continue to grow in popularity, BaseDAO will prioritize education and onboarding resources to help new users understand the value of decentralized governance. These programs could include workshops, tutorials, and online courses focused on DAO creation, governance best practices, and community engagement strategies.

With the development of these planned features, we hope that BaseDAO will become a one-stop platform for all things DAO-related on Aptos.

## Conclusion

BaseDAO is committed to lowering the barriers to decentralized governance, enabling anyone to build and manage a DAO with ease on Aptos. 

By expanding our governance models, enhancing integrations, and offering robust community tools, BaseDAO seeks to be the go-to platform for DAO creation and management. 

As the world continues to embrace decentralized technologies, BaseDAO will be at the forefront, empowering communities to build, collaborate, and drive meaningful change.
